## About

The portal is made in consideration with enhancing the participants' experience of the event and make it more enjoyable with the effective use of technological and management aspects hand in hand. 

The portal basically handles round one of the whole event, which has 2 parts round 1.1 and round 1.2.

Our challenge was to make it synchronized across teammates and as interactive as possible ,we took the help of Socket.io and Agora RTC Engine to make it happen. We managed to create an environment in-order to increase interactivity by implementing a voice channel thread across the platform and voice chat for participants on an atomic level.

## Features of our platform

- <h3>Real Time Collaboration:</h3>The website focused on bringing the essence of the multiplayer game to the forefront through live synchronization for coordinated drag and drop functionalities
- <h3>Voice Chat Support</h3> We provided functionalities such that the users would be able to collaborate in every round i.e. through the means of group voice chat throughout the platform.
- <h3>Moderation Support</h3> An App was paired to the website that allowed moderators to supervise, and made it possible to interact with the participants as and when required
